<h1>J.P. Morgan Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program</h1>
Overview
This repository contains my solutions to the tasks from the J.P. Morgan Software Engineering Virtual Experience program hosted by Forage. The virtual program focuses on the use of technology in investment banking and offers hands-on experience with data visualization, Python programming, and financial data analysis.

Project Introduction
In this project, I worked on a series of tasks to simulate real-world situations faced by software engineers at J.P. Morgan. The tasks revolved around using stock price data to build useful financial tools such as real-time data feeds and visualization dashboards. The program also provided insights into how engineers contribute to the development of trading systems.

Technologies Used
Python: Used for backend development and data processing.
JavaScript: Used for frontend implementation.
Perspective: A powerful data visualization tool used to create interactive financial charts.
Git: Version control for managing code changes.
Flask: A Python-based micro-framework used for running the backend services.
Tasks Overview
Task 1: Interface with a Stock Price Data Feed
Objective:
In this task, I developed a Python program that connects to a J.P. Morgan stock price data feed and retrieves live stock price data. The program processes the feed and calculates the price change for each stock in real-time.

Key Steps:

Set up the data feed using a simulated API.
Parse the incoming data.
Calculate and print price changes for each stock.
Files:

client3.py: Handles the connection to the data feed and processing of stock price changes.
